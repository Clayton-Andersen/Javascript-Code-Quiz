# Javascript-Code-Quiz
Use Web API and DOM manipulation to create interactive timed quiz
## requirements
The quiz timer acts as score keeper by counting down as the participant answers series of questions. Wrong answers make time increment by 10. Scores are sent to local storage.

## issues to overcome:
### iterate through questions and check user input
### if right, next question, if incorrect, deduct time from counter
### after iterating all questions or time expires, create game end
### local storage for score and user initials
Work in progress and will be complete within near future
